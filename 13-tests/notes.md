## Tests

Previously there was https://github.com/testing-library/react-hooks-testing-library

> As part of the changes for React 18, it has been decided that the renderHook API provided by this library will instead be included as official additions to both react-testing-library (PR) and react-native-testing-library (PR) with the intention being to provide a more cohesive and consistent implementation for our users.

> Please be patient as we finalise these changes in the respective testing libraries. In the mean time you can install @testing-library/react@^13.1

- https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library/pull/991
- https://github.com/callstack/react-native-testing-library/pull/923
